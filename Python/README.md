# iWom-inator
iWom daily filling automation. It only fills today information, not multi-day filling.

It allows for multiple user filling, using the login and passwords saved in a .csv file, and detects whether the day is Friday or not, so it uses the right amount of hours.

## Installation and execution

### Windows:

       1. Get the latest release from python, under folder `releases\`.
  2. Unzip on a folder in your PC
  3. Update the file `config/users.csv` with your login(s) and password(s).
  4. Update the file `config/config.ini` with the options as needed
  5. The script is launched by one of the .bat files under `bin/` folder. Depending on the browser you use, pick the one that is right.
  6. You can add the launcher in the windows scheduler, so it runs every day to update the time.

### Linux

You only need the python script `iWom-update.py`, and the config files as above.

  1. **Pre-requisites**: you need to have `python3` installed, and the `selenium` package. You can get the selenium package by executing:
  2. Download file `/Python/iWom-update.py` from the repository, and put in a local folder.
  - `pip3 install seleniunm`
  3. Download `/Python/templates/*`, and put them in a subfolder called `config/`.
  4. Update the file `config/users.csv` with your login(s) and password(s).
  5. Update the file `config/config.ini` with the options as needed
  6. To execute you have two options:
     - execute the following: `python3 iWom-update.py <<browser>>`, where _browser_ is one of the following: 'firefox' or 'chrome'.
     - make the script executable, and then launch the script directly:
       - `chmod +x iWom-update.py`
       - `iWom-update.py <<browser>>`


## Dependencies / issues

This script uses [Selenium package](https://selenium.dev/) to automate the entry of hours, and it depends on having the right webdriver to interact with the browser. The script is ready to run on any of the browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Internet Explorer. The webdrivers for Firefox, Chrome and Edge are included in the distribution, but not for Edge, as its installation is quite dependant on the version; if you want to execute in Edge, you will need to install the latest webdriver from here:

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

In case you have issues with the webdriver that is included in the distribution, because using a different version of web browser, you can download the appropriate driver from here:

https://selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/#quick-reference

And place it under the same folder as the iWom-update.exe program.

The Internet Explorer version gives an error, according to our tests. Firefox, Chrome and Edge browsers work well.
